# PARTH - by Team D2
PARTH is an algorithm visualisation tool built for the [Computer Science](http://cs.bham.ac.uk) Team Project module at [University of Birmingham](http://www.bham.ac.uk)

## Aims
* The program should have been modular, accepting any compatible visualisations in the `.vism` format.
* The program was to be written in Java *This was a strict constraint*
* Tasks were to be distributed amongst team members to even the load

## Usage
1. Clone the repository into a local directory
```
git clone https://github.com/frebib/teamproject-app.git PARTH-Visualiser
```

2. Compile the project to self-contained executable `.jar` file with [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)
```
ant build-jar
```

3. Run and learn!
```
cd dist
java -jar PARTH.jar
```
